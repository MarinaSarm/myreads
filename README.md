# MyReads Project

This is the project from starter template for the project for Udacity's Front-End Development Nanodegree.

## Overview

This is a simple app to manage books. All books are stored on 3 shelves: Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read.
You can search new books by using Search function and add book directly to one of the shelves.
You can also remove book from shelves.

## Installation

The application was created with create-react-app. To start:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Backend Server

Books served by a backend server.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is my project for Udacity. Therefore, I will not accept pull requests.
